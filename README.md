## Project 4: Chicago West Nile Virus

This was the first and only group project I did for General Assembly's Data Science Immersive. Working on this project tested not only my data science skills, but also my collaboration skills. The goal of this project was to use mosquito population, weather, and pesticide spray data to predict where and when West Nile Virus will occur in the city of Chicago. The data came from a [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/), although the point of the project was not to get the best score. The goal was to give a 20 minute group presentation to a mixed group of experts, including biostatisticians, epidemiologists, and non-technical decision-makers. As such, we had to create a strategy for mosquito abatement in addition to a model.

My biggest contributionto the group project was in the modeling section, where I created a spatiotemporal model to predict West Nile Virus presence based on historical weather conditions and pesticides spraying. Unfortunately, our dataset was incomplete so I only was able to use the 2013 data. Looking back, I could have dug aroudn the internet to find additional data, but I didn't think to do that at the time.
